## 4lyr_Trrain_Prlx_Vrtx_Blnd.shader

This shader is based on parallax shaders of Unity with 4 layers support similar used in GTA Rage Engine games.

Layers | Vertex Colors
----|--------
Layer 1 | Red
Layer 2 | Green
Layer 3 | Blue
Layer 4 | Alpha Vertex Color Channel

List:

* 1 Parallax maps for each layer.
* 1 Normal maps for each layer.
* Change specular color and intensity of material for all layers.
* Change height of each four parallax map textures.

DX11 is needed. I don't knot if Vulkan is supported.
